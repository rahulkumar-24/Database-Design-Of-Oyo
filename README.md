## Introduction

OYO is a hospitality chain that aggregates budget hotels and standardizes guest experiences. This project aims to break down the functionality and relationships of OYO's system into a structured database design. The database includes all the core elements, such as customers, hotels, rooms, bookings, payments, reviews, and complaints.

## Database Design

The database design is centered around key entities that form the backbone of the OYO business model.

## Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

The ERD visually represents the relationships between the entities in the OYO system.
